# Covers al_email_protect: renders when its gate is on, and renders nothing
# when it is off.
#
# The "off" half is the point. It is two-layer gated, so a regression does
# not raise an error — the Liquid tag just returns an empty string and the
# feature silently disappears. Only asserting the rendered output catches that.
#
# al_rtl and al_marimo used to be covered here via the `_posts/2022-...-rtl.md`
# and `_posts/2025-...-marimo.md` demo posts, but this site excludes `_posts/`
# (see _config.yml), so those fixtures no longer build. Re-add coverage for
# them if the site ever ships real RTL or marimo content.

# Scope note: this asserts the gating and the runtime, NOT that site-wide

# emails itself (`mailto:{{ social[1] | encode_email }}`), so the plugin is not
# consulted for them — a layout has to call {% al_email_protect_link %}. Wiring
# core's socials through the plugin needs a change in that gem; until then,
# asserting "no mailto: anywhere" would be asserting something untrue, and
# asserting "mailto: still present" would codify the gap as correct.
